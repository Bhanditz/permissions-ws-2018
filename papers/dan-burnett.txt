= Requirements =

From the CfP:
A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:
* Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.
* Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.
* Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.

David Rosenthal (a digital archivist) stated in his blog post that the immutability of blockchains will make it quite difficult to comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). 


= Position =

Private chains or sidechains limit which blockchain nodes have visibility to data in transit and storage[a].


Privacy aspects being explored for Enterprise Ethereum would be reasonable ways forward. Examples[b] include:
* Just because blockchain information is immutable doesn’t necessarily mean it is accessible or even complete. The immutable parts may simply be pointers, for example. PII may be stored off-chain.
* PII information may be restricted to only blockchain nodes involved in a private transaction (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric’s channels).
* PII information may be represented on-chain in an encrypted state. Throwing away relevant encryption keys would make data inaccessible (e.g. Quorum’s approach to privacy).
* Ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, or similar techniques may be used to limit and control exposure to PII.
