<h1 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>The web has facilitated participation in society and the economy for people with disabilities to a degree undreamt of by pre-web persons with disabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>People with disabilities are often early adopters simply because web services are intrinsically vastly superior. This is just another way of restating the above point.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, it is easy to exclude people with disabilities by simply not thinking about them during design and development.</p>
<h2 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h2>
<p>Many users are highly reluctant to participate in online activities that may heuristically reveal that they are a person with a disability.</p>
<p>Revealing the user’s disability may not only be damaging, it may also be irrelevant to the task. But not always. For example, it’s irrelevant when I buy groceries online, but I want my Uber driver to know I won’t see them when they arrive and I need them to identify themselves to me before I can get into their vehicle.</p>

<ul class="incremental">
<li>It won’t happen by itself</li>
<li>Add accessibility to your development cycle</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="u-i-is-still-paramount">U-I is still Paramount</h2>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><a href="Fundamentals%20of%20Web%20Accessibility">https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/</a></li>
<li><p>W3C/WAI accessibility specifications form the basis of international web accessibility standards and multiple national regulatory requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>WCAG (currently at v. 2.1) <a href="providase%20U-I%20specifics">https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/</a> on making U-I and web controls easily understandable, perceivable, operable for people with disabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple, relevant and and targeted</p></li>
<li><p>Change isn’t always good. Predictable and familiar U-I design and controls are critical for persons with many disabilities, especially cognitive and learning disabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about how to facilitate time-out extensions. These are often critical.</p></li>
<li><p>Think in terms of multi-party transactions, e.g. authenticate with Google or FaceBook, and ask yourself only for the specifics you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Support options for users. A single way of doing things is problematic. Give users options that can change as user needs change.</p></li>

<p>The <a href="Web%20Accessibility%20Initiative">https://www.w3.org/wai/</a> is the home page for accessibility at the W3C.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-and-learning-disabilities">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</h3>
<p>A WAI Task Force is developing guidance for on how to support the needs of persons with various cognitive and learning disabilities. Publications under development include:</p>
