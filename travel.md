# Hotels

Suggested hotel:
* The Hyatt House appears to still have a few rooms on both Tuesday and Wednesday, but not of the same room type - the two nights would need to be booked separately (or perhaps by phone).  We're working on getting more rooms released or, alternatively, obtaining online booking credentials for one of the other hotels.
* Hyatt House San Diego/Sorrento Mesa, .9 miles away (closer walking?), 1 Bedroom, Qualcomm rate $172, breakfast/internet/parking inclusive.  Shuttle available. [Book online](https://www.hyatt.com/shop/sanxs?rooms=1&adults=1&location=Hyatt%20House%20San%20Diego%2FSorrento%20Mesa&checkinDate=2018-09-25&checkoutDate=2018-09-27&corp_id=99867&kids=0) using corporate code 99867

Other options:
* Holiday Inn Express & Suites San Diego-Sorrento Valley, .5 miles away, 2 double beds, Qualcomm rate $142, breakfast/internet/parking inclusive, (858) 731-0100
